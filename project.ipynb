This is the first Budget in Amrit \\nKaal . \\nIntroduction \\n1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous \\nBudget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous \\nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes.  \\n2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented \\nthrough Sabka Prayas  resulting in Jan Bhagidari  and targeted support to \\nthose in need, helped us perform well in trying times. India’s rising global '},\n",

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire \\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges \\n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a \\nunique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. \\nWith the theme of ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ , we are steering an \\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \\nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind \\n7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a \\nbetter quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more \\nthan doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.   \\n8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from \\nbeing 10th to 5th largest in the world. We have significantly improved our \\nposition as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive \\nenvironment for business as reflected in several global indices. We have \\nmade significant progress in many Sustainable Development Goals.  '},\n",

The economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the \\nEPFO membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital \\npayments of ` 126 lakh crore through UPI in 2022.    \\n10. The efficient implementation of many schemes, with \\nuniversalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development. \\nSome of the schemes are: \\ni. 11.7 crore household toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission,  \\nii. 9.6 crore LPG connections under Ujjawala,  \\niii. 220 crore Covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,    \\niv. 47.8 crore PM Jan Dhan bank accounts, \\nv.

Cash transfer of ` 2.2 lakh crore to over 11.4 crore farmers \\nunder PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. \\nVision for Amrit Kaal  – an empowered and inclusive economy \\n11. Our vision for the Amrit Kaal  includes technology-driven and \\nknowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust \\nfinancial sector. To achieve this, Jan Bhagidari through Sabka Saath Sabka \\nPrayas  is essential.   \\n12. The economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three \\nthings: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the \\nyouth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth \\nand job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.    \\n13. To service these focus areas in our journey to India@100, we believe \\nthat the following four opportunities can be transformative during Amrit \\nKaal.  '},\n",

Through supporting policies, they will be enabled to \\nscale up their operations to serve the large consumer markets, as \\nhas been the case with several start-ups growing into ‘Unicorns’. \\n2) PM VIshwakarma KAushal Samman (PM VIKAS) : For centuries, \\ntraditional artisans and craftspeople, who work with their hands \\nusing tools, have brought renown for India. They are generally \\nreferred to as Vishwakarma. The art and handicraft created by them \\nrepresents the true spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. For the first time, a \\npackage of assistance for them has been conceptualized.

The \\ncomponents of the scheme will include not only financial support \\nbut also access to advanced skill training, knowledge of modern \\ndigital techniques and efficient green technologies, brand \\npromotion, linkage with local and global markets, digital payments, \\nand social security. This will greatly benefit the Scheduled Castes, \\nScheduled Tribes, OBCs, women and people belonging to the weaker \\nsections.  \\n3) Tourism : The country offers immense attraction for domestic as well \\nas foreign tourists. There is a large potential to be tapped in tourism. \\nThe sector holds huge opportunities for jobs and entrepreneurship \\nfor youth in particular.  Promotion of tourism will be taken up on \\nmission mode, with active participation of states, convergence of \\ngovernment programmes and public-private partnerships. '},\n",

The new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh Nil \\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \\nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, \\nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \\n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \\nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  \\n149. My third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners \\nincluding family pensioners, for whom I propose to extend the benefit of '},\n",
       " {'page': 38,\n",
       "  'content': '34 \\n \\n \\n standard deduction to the new tax regime. Each salaried person with an \\nincome of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. \\n150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the \\nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \\npm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to \\nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh. \\n152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \\nregime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the \\nbenefit of the old tax regime. \\n153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in \\nthe annexure. \\n154. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –  \\n` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be \\nforgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. \\nThus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. \\n155. Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to this \\naugust House. \\n***** \\n  '},\n",

PROVIDING TAX RELIEF  UNDER NEW PERSONAL T AX REGIME  \\nA.1     The new tax regime for Individual and HUF , introduced by the \\nFinance Act 2020, is now proposed to be the default regime.  \\nA.2      This regime would also become the default regime for AOP (other \\nthan co-operative), BOI and AJP.  \\nA.3      Any individual, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI or AJP not \\nwilling to be taxed under this new regime can opt to be taxed \\nunder the old regime. For those person having income under the \\nhead “profit and gains of business or profession” and having opted \\nfor old regime can revoke that option only once and after that \\nthey will continue to be taxed under the new regime. For those \\nnot having income under the head “profit and gains of business or \\nprofession”, option for old regime may be exercised in each year. \\nA.4      Substantial relief is proposed under the new regime with new slabs \\nand tax rates as under: \\nTotal Income ( `) Rate (per cent)  \\nUpto 3,00,000  Nil \\nFrom 3,00,001 to 6,00,000  5 \\nFrom 6,00,001 to 9,00,000  10 \\nFrom 9,00,001 to 12,00,000 15 \\nFrom 12,00,001 to 15,00,000  20 \\nAbove 15,00,000  30 \\n \\nA.5      Resident individual with total income up to ` 5,00,000 do not pay \\nany tax due to rebate under both old and new regime. It is \\nproposed to increase the rebate for the resident individual under \\nthe new regime so that they do not pay tax if their total income is \\nup to ` 7,00,000. \\nA.6     Standard deduction of ` 50,000 to salaried individual, and '},\n",

Highest surcharge \\nshall be 25 per cent for income above  \\n` 2 crore. This would reduce the maximum rate from about 42.7 \\nper cent to about 39 per cent. No change in surcharge is proposed \\nfor those who opt to be under the old regime. \\nA.8      Encashment of earned leave up to 10 months of average salary, at \\nthe time of retirement in case of an employee (other than an \\nemployee of the Central Government or State Government), is \\nexempt under sub-clause (ii) of clause (10AA) of section 10 of the \\nIncome-tax Act (“the Act”) to the extent notified.

Introduction  1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous  Budget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous  and inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and  citizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes.   2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the  Indian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is  estimated to be at 7 per cent.
